## Instructions and Controls

## Project Description
This is a pedadogical tool that implements Voronoi fractures on a 2D plane in C# and visualizes them using Unity game engine. The fractures are generated by implementing the dual solution of Delaunay's traingulation to Voronoi fractures. This is then connected to Unity game engine where these fractures are displayed and different sprites (shapes) can be used to show the fractures. It also has a replay functionality to show the fractures splitting up.
